# plant-disease-detection-project
ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify plant diseases using advanced machine learning and image processing techniques. By leveraging a robust dataset of plant leaf images, the model identifies unhealthy plants and categorizes the type of disease, enabling early intervention and reducing crop losses.
